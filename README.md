## Code smarter not harder. Over 1000 Resources for web developers. 

## Less searching...More Learning...Duh!

### Summary

I've been coding for a little over a year and I've barely scratched the surface of all there is to know about web development. Learning to code takes practice...a lot of practice. I'm talking hours and hours in front of a computer researching: libraries, frameworks, packages, scripts, back-end, front-end, functions, loops, variables, elements, classes, objects, algorithms, & abbreviations: html, css, js, api, mvc, mvp, oop, dom, orm, pwa, sql, npm, git, cli… And the list goes on. It’s taken me a year just to understand the basics, but you don't have to be an expert engineer to build a functional application...just expect to spend a few late nights banging your head against the keyboard. Part of being a good developer is just knowing where to look, and having the right resources at your disposal. There are so many free tools lot of free tools don't worry about being the smartest person in the room. Odds are the answer is already out there for you. A free, opensource, resource, tools, resources,  A lot of the work is already done for you. Don't waste your time writing to code. Spend time researching the theories and principle, and learning the fundamentals.
