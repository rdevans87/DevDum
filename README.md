## Code smarter not harder. Over 1000 Resources for web developers. It's a no brainer...duh!

### Summary

I've been coding for a little over a year and I've barely scratched the surface of all there is to know about web development. Learning to code takes practice...a lot of practice. I'm talking hours and hours in front of a computer screen: languages, libraries, frameworks, packages, scripts, back-end, front-end, functions, loops, variables, elements, classes, objects, algorithms, & abbreviations: html, css, api, mvc, mvp, oop, dom, orm, pwa, sql, npm, git, cli… And the list goes on, but I’ll stop there and let you find out for yourself. It’s taken me a year just to understand the basics, but you don't have to be an expert engineer to build a functional application...just expect to spend a few late nights banging your head against the keyboard. Even a simple application in all  actuality is extremely complex. It requires theory and logic and a whole lot of patience.  Imposter syndrome is real!   Part of being a good developer is knowing where to look. If you have a computer or smart phone, you're already in good shape. A solid internet connection is also important. If you're not sure where to begin, this is a good place to start. The dev community is full of intelligent people who have built a ton of cool tech.  so don't worry about being the smartest person in the room. Odds are the answer is already out there for you. A free, opensource, resource, tools, resources,  A lot of the work is already done for you. Don't waste your time writing to code. Spend time researching the theories and principle, and learning the fundamentals.
