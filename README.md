# DevDum!

### Code smarter not harder with over 200+ resources for web developers. 

### Summary

Learning to code takes time...a lot of time. I'm talking hours and hours in front of a computer researching: languages, libraries, frameworks, theories, methods, principles, packages, back-end, front-end, functions, arrays, loops, variables, elements, classes, objects, algorithms & abbreviations: html, css, js, json, dom, api, mvc, mvp, oop, orm, pwa, sql, npm, git, cliâ€¦ And the list goes on. 

If you're like me...then you don't have all the time in the world to devote to web development. The good news is you don't have to be an expert engineer to build a solid website or application anymore...just expect to spend a few late nights banging your head against the keyboard. 

Part of being a good developer is just knowing where to look, and having the right resources at your fingertips to help you: packages, components, widgets, wizards, addons, extensions, optimizers, plugins, scrapers, converters, generators, templates, boilerplates, repositories...you get the idea!
 
Do your best to learn the fundamentals and understand the principles, but don't worry about being the smartest developer in the room. The dev community runs deep and there is a lot to explore. The best way to learn web devcelopment is by doing. DevDum! will save you countless hours searching the web, so you can focus on developing whatever crazy idea you've got in your head. Just remember the DevDum rule of thumb: Code Smarter Not Harder. 

Take advantage of all the free & open source options available on the internet: code snippets, cheat sheets, static websites, even fully developed applications ready to deploy. You'll be surprised what you can find, and what's already been built for you to use. 

DevDum contains all the resources needed for developing a fullstack web application. Hopefully, it saves you some of the headache along the way. If there's anything else you want to know, you'll have to find it on your own, but if you discover anything cool, please let me know about it! I'm always looking to add more resources to my repertoire! 

Give this repo a star and share if you like DevDum! Happy coding and thanks for stopping by!
