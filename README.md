## Code smarter not harder. Over 1000 Resources for web developers. It's a no brainer...duh!

### Summary

I've been coding for a little over a year and I've barely scratched the surface of all there is to know about web development. Learning to code takes practice...a lot of practice. I'm talking hours and hours in front of a computer screen: languages, libraries, frameworks, packages, scripts, back-end, front-end, functions, loops, variables, elements, classes, objects, algorithms, & abbreviations: html, css, api, mvc, oop, dom, orm, pwa, sql, npm, git, cli… And the list goes on, but I’ll stop there and let you find out for yourself. It’s taken me a year just to understand the basics, but I’m also not very smart either. I consider myself an intelligent guy, but I’m not going to quit my day job to become a full time developer. Not yet anyway! I’ve spent plenty of late nights banging my head against the keyboard. Imposter syndrome is real! It's easy to get discouraged and feel stupid, but you're not an idiot just because you don't know something. Part of being a good developer is knowing where to look. If you have a computer or smart phone, you're already in good shape. A solid internet connection is also important. If you're not sure where to begin, this is a good place to start. The tech community is full of smart people,   Don't waste your time writing to code.   


haMy point is lot of time and research has gone into this  is no end to what you can find 


itUnfortunately, I don't have all the time in  Unfortunately, I  compiled a list of resources I've use for just about every imaginable
