### Summary

I've been coding for a little over a year and I've barely scratched the surface of all there is to know about web development. Learning to code takes practice...a lot of practice. I'm talking hours and hours in front of a computer screen. The rabbit hole goes deep: languages, libraries, frameworks, packages, scripts, back-end, front-end, functions, loops, variables, elements, classes, objects, algorithms, & abbreviations: html, css, api, mvc, oop, dom, orm, pwa, sql, npm, git, cli… And the list goes on, but I’ll stop there and let you find out for yourself. It’s taken me a year just to understand the basics, but I’m also not very smart. I consider myself an intelligent guy, but I’m not going to quit my day job to become a full time developer. I’ve spent plenty of late nights banging my head against the keyboard. Imposter syndrome is real!
